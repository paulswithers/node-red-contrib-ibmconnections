This package contains a set of nodes to interact with IBM Connections.

# *Changes*
## Changes in V1.4.1
* The **Get Files** node now returns also **folders** (optionally in a recursive way)
* We added an **Upload File node** that enables uploading files to IBM Connections. The node supports uploading a file into the user's library and into a community's library.
* The **Get AS node** has been limited to returning 20 entries by default. For this reason we added the parameter *count* for specifying the maximum number of returned entries.
